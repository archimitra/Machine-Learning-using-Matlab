# Machine-Learning-using-Matlab
This is my attempt at learning and implementing various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms via the assignments of Machine Learing course by Stanford University at Coursera.
While some part of codes are provied by the good people who prepared the course, critical portions of each algorithms was coded by me. A PDF in each algorithm can be referred to understand which pieces were provided and which were written by me.
In nutshell, I had fun implementing each algorithm while learing how to use each for Digit Recognition, Image Compression, Spam Classifier etc.
